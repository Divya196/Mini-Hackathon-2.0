Electric Vehicle (EV) Market Analysis

In this Data Science challenge ,Dataset used : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/srinrealyf/india-ev-market-data  

#SITUATION:
My task is to explore the India EV Market dataset and uncover valuable insights about the electric vehicle industry.

#TASK:
Before looking into the dataset, I studied about fundamental working principle of EV and fundamental of a business,

what all the areas we need to primaryly looking into. 

I listed like: 

1.Trends
2. Consumer behaviour
3.Competition 
4. Policies
5.Technology.

Understanding the data , I got 5 excel data from the kaggle dataset, I am checking to get the insights of above list, which excel data i can refer. 

The given data's are:

1.EV Maker name, their location including place and state

2.EV Sales by year ,category and EV maker

3.Total Registration based on EV Categories.

4.Manufacturing count for each category by each month and year.

5. Operational Public charging station count based on state.

#ACTIONS:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing:
   -->Removing Duplicates
   -->Checking for null and Missing values
   -->Data Aggregation
2. Did analysis using pandas.
3. Created line and bar charts visualization to show the trend and analysis using Matplotlib and seaborn

   
#RESULTS:


1.The demand for EVs changed after 2015 rapidly, the graph shows that the demand will be be high for upcoming years

2.Maharastra and TamilNadu are leading in EV adoption, the reason might be because of government policies, environmental awareness and budget friendly. We can drive easliy in traffic using EV, Might be because if this advantage. The only feature ,ev maker needs to work might be in safety.

3.Yes, policy changes resulted in noticeable shifts in adoption rates. It will increase in future.

4.Ola has the highest market share, the factor is they focused on two wheelers and improving the performance using technologies than working on mutliple category.

5.UP, Punjab and Haryana have higher rate in pollution based on articles.

Currently , Maharashtra and TamilNadu have the hightes EV Maker Plant
We need to initiate in setting up more EV maker plant in Punjab, Haryana and UP . The consumption of EV will increase in those states because government will be implementing policies in order to reduce the pollution

6.Two Wheeler got the highest registration among all the category. In future, Two Wheeler (NT), Three wheeler (T) will be more in demand .

7.Consumers are prefering motorized vehicle. We need to plan to increase the production in these categories inorder to increase the profit. 

8.Light weight vehicles got high registration.It will be more in demand.

9.Other mentioned category vehicle used for specific purpose also holds decent sales, We should focus on that, so hopefully the specific purpose vehicle demand also will increase.

10.2015 the ev consumption gradually increases. May be due to covid , we saw slight drop in graph . However,in past 5 years, there is a rapid increase in adoption of EV.

11.Monthwise - March.May,July,September and November, we can see sales are higher compared to even months. We can expect high sales in next March.

12.There are many small scale ev maker evolving in industries.

13.List of Top Competitors in the EV industry.

1.OLA ELECTRIC TECHNOLOGIES PVT LTD

2.TVS MOTOR COMPANY LTD  

3.ATHER ENERGY PVT LTD 

4.HERO ELECTRIC VEHICLES PVT. LTD 

5.BAJAJ AUTO LTD 

6.OKINAWA AUTOTECH PVT LTD

7.YC ELECTRIC VEHICLE 

8.AMPERE VEHICLES PRIVATE LIMITED 

14. In that top competitors list, manufacturing units are 3 from TamilNadu. From this ,we can assume TamilNadu will have more manufacturing units in future compared to other states.
